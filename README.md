# phoneMnemonics
Scala program that when given a phone number returns a word or word sequence it spells out on a touch tone pad


Martin Odersky, the inventor of Scala likes to show off the power of Scala and functional programming with a solution of
the “phone mnemonics” problem. Given a phone number, what word or word sequence spells it on a touch-tone pad? 
For example, given the phone number 435 569 6753, one should come up with the sequence HELLO WORLD (and maybe others).

This program does not use recursion
